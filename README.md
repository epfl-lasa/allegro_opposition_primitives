allegro_opposition_primitives
-----------------------------

This package implements a grasp controller for opposition primitives. A single opposition primitive represents a subset of grasping surfaces on that hand that are set up into 2 opposing groups for the purpose of applying oppositional pressure on a grasped object. A grasp can contain one or more opposition primitives.

This package provides a set of predefined opposition primitive based grasps, with commands to open and close the hand according to the predefined oppositional intention. Additionally, the sequeezing level along each axis of opposition can be independently or jointly specified.

It is also straightforward to define new primitive-based grasps. 

The package provides a gui interface and a topic-based interface to control the opening/closing of the hand and the squeeze level.
